        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 1:</span> EVs Have Limited Range</h2>
            <p>Many believe electric vehicles can't go far on a single charge.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> Modern EVs offer ranges that are more than sufficient for daily use. Many models now provide ranges between 200-300 miles on a single charge, with some high-end models exceeding 300 miles. For most people, this range is more than enough for daily commuting and even longer trips.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 2:</span> EVs Are Too Expensive</h2>
            <p>People think EVs cost too much compared to gas vehicles.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> While the upfront cost of EVs can be higher than traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, the total cost of ownership is often lower. EVs have fewer moving parts, which means lower maintenance costs. Additionally, electricity is generally cheaper than gasoline, leading to savings on fuel. Many governments also offer incentives and tax rebates for EV purchases, further reducing the effective cost.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 3:</span> EVs Are Not Environmentally Friendly Because of Battery Production</h2>
            <p>Some claim EVs harm the environment due to battery manufacturing.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> While it's true that battery production has an environmental impact, studies have shown that over their lifetime, EVs are still more environmentally friendly than ICE vehicles. This is due to their higher efficiency and the fact that they produce zero tailpipe emissions. As renewable energy sources become more prevalent, the environmental benefits of EVs will only increase.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 4:</span> There Are Not Enough Charging Stations</h2>
            <p>People worry about the lack of charging infrastructure.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> The charging infrastructure for EVs is rapidly expanding. In many countries, governments and private companies are investing heavily in building more charging stations. Additionally, most EV charging is done at home overnight, making public charging stations less critical for daily use.
            </div>

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 5:</span> EVs Are Slow and Boring to Drive</h2>
            <p>Some think EVs lack excitement and performance.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> EVs are known for their instant torque, which provides quick acceleration and a responsive driving experience. Many EVs offer performance that rivals or exceeds that of traditional sports cars. The driving experience is often described as smooth and quiet, which many drivers find enjoyable.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 6:</span> EV Batteries Degrade Quickly</h2>
            <p>There's concern that EV batteries wear out fast.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> Modern EV batteries are designed to last a long time. Most manufacturers offer warranties for their batteries that cover 8 years or 100,000 miles, and many batteries retain a significant portion of their capacity even after that period. Proper care and maintenance can further extend the life of an EV battery.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 7:</span> EVs Are Not Suitable for Cold Weather</h2>
            <p>People believe EVs perform poorly in cold climates.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> While it's true that cold weather can reduce the range of an EV, advancements in battery technology and thermal management systems have mitigated this issue. Many EVs now come with features like battery pre-conditioning, which helps maintain optimal battery temperature and performance in cold weather.

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 8:</span> The Grid Can't Handle Widespread EV Adoption</h2>
            <p>Some worry the power grid will collapse under EV demand.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> The electrical grid is more than capable of handling the increased load from EVs, especially since most charging is done overnight when demand is low. Additionally, smart grid technologies and time-of-use pricing can help manage and distribute the load more efficiently.
            </div>

        <section class="myth">
            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 9:</span> EVs Are Not Safe</h2>
            <p>There's a belief that EVs pose unique safety risks.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> EVs undergo the same rigorous safety testing as traditional vehicles and often have additional safety features due to their design. The heavy battery packs in EVs can actually make them more stable and less prone to rollovers. Additionally, EVs are designed with multiple safety systems to protect the battery and electrical components.

            <h2><span class="myth-number">Myth 10:</span> EVs Are Just a Fad</h2>
            <p>Some see EVs as a passing trend.</p>
            <div class="reality">
                <strong>Reality:</strong> The shift towards electric vehicles is driven by global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change. Major automakers are investing billions in EV development, and many countries have set targets to phase out ICE vehicles. EVs are a key component of the future of transportation.
